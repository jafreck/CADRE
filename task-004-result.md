# Task Result: task-004 - Add CostReport Interface to Reporting Types

## Changes Made
- `src/reporting/types.ts`: Added `CostReportAgentEntry`, `CostReportPhaseEntry`, and `CostReport` interfaces

## Files Modified
- src/reporting/types.ts

## Files Created
- (none)

## Notes
- All three interfaces are exported and follow the existing style in the file
- Pre-existing TypeScript error in `src/core/issue-orchestrator.ts` is unrelated to this task
