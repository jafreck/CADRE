  "title": "Fix login timeout handling",
  "body": "## Problem\n\nThe login handler does not respect the configured timeout value. When a user's session takes longer than expected, the system hangs indefinitely instead of timing out.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe login handler should:\n1. Use the timeout value from the configuration\n2. Return a `408 Request Timeout` if the login takes too long\n3. Log the timeout event for debugging\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Set `LOGIN_TIMEOUT=5000` in config\n2. Simulate a slow authentication backend (>5s response)\n3. Observe that the login request never times out\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThis affects both the REST API and the GraphQL mutation. The timeout logic was removed in PR #35 as part of a refactor.",
